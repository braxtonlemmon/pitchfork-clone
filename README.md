# Pitchfork Clone Project
I have been studying [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum and want to solidify everything I've learned about mobile-first responsive design. In this project I will be replicating [Pitchfork's](https://pitchfork.com/#) home page using all the skill I've developed in my HTML/CSS studies.
